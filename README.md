# Weather-API

Upon entering a city into the input and clicking the button, the application will load the weather for the day, and the five day forecast below. The UV index is colour coded based on number. 

When a city is searched, it is saved to local storage and a button is added below the search bar that will allow for renavigation to the city weather page.
